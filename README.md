# Welcome to Syntactic Processing Code Demonstrations:
> This README file is designed to navigate the code files and the datasets that have been used to demonstrate the use cases of various concepts taught in the Syntactic Processing module.

## Table of Contents
* [How to download files?](#general-information)
* [What is where?](#technologies-used)


<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## How to download files?
-  Click on Code button and then click on Download ZIP OR Use git clone command on your terminal if git is installed in your machine.

## What is where?

As you can see there are three many files when you log in:

You will find all the code files on following sessions. 

**Heteronyms Detection POS Tagging Use Case:**
You will find the following code files for  heteronyms detection use case that have been demonstrated in PoS tagging session.

**POS Tagging Case Study:**
